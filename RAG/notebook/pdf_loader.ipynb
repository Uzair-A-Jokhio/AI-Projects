However, in recent years numerous \\nissues like climate change, reduced productivity, narrowing resources, and increased prevalence have emerged. \\nIn order to combat these obstacles, we devised a plan that integrates IoT, AI ML, and geospatial technology. By \\nanalyzing 45 industrial reports and peer-reviewed journals we found out that the use of advanced technology \\nmakes resource optimization, irrigation management, and disease detection significantly easier. Our findings \\nreveal some astonishing facts like the efficiency of CNN neural networks in terms of disease detection which \\nstood at an impressive 92 %, then there are neural networks that achieve an accuracy of 88.9 % in predicting the \\nyield of crops. Lastly, RL has managed to attain a water-saving efficiency of an impressive 25.4 %. Despite these \\nadvancements, the adoption rate in Africa is still low, this can be attributed to poor infrastructure, lack of funds, \\nand absence of professional knowledge. In order to counter these shortcomings, we suggest political term ini\\xad\\ntiatives, initiatives aimed at enhancing expertise and knowledge, and affordable IOT implementation. In addition \\nto identifying the socio-economic and infrastructural barriers to technology adoption, this essay also offers \\nsuggestions that advocate for facilitating sustainable agricultural practices in Africa. So that the identified gaps \\nare bridged, the research aids in enhancing climate change resilience for sustainable growth in the agriculture \\nindustry of the continent.\\n1. Introduction\\nThe continent of Africa is highly susceptible to changes in weather, \\ncausing shifts in the environment that affect agriculture. Despite this, \\nagriculture contributes a lot towards the GDP of several African nations \\nthereby employing many people. However, there are more frequent and \\nsevere droughts from floods and higher temperatures which pose serious \\nthreats to agricultural production and even food security in Africa [1,2].\\nThere have been many recent technological developments in artifi\\xad\\ncial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and the Internet of Things \\n(IoT) that are meant to address these problems. These new methods will \\ngreatly improve agricultural resilience through optimized resource \\nallocation as well as better decision-making. A case example is where AI \\nand machine learning get used in analyzing intricate data sets for \\npurposes of predicting climate impacts, field crop health monitoring, \\nand designing adaptive strategies [3,4]. This means that such tools \\nenable precision agriculture by offering real-time data collection and \\nmonitoring which significantly enhances productivity and sustainability \\n[5,6]. Lastly, remote sensing as one of the geospatial technologies helps \\nunderstand land use patterns and changes in the environment thereby \\naiding in policy formulation [7,8].\\nNotwithstanding the potential advantages of these advancements, \\nthere are also several issues regarding their mainstreaming in the \\ncontinent including inadequacies in infrastructure and hence the mod\\xad\\nerate adoption [9,10]. This calls for the development of comprehensive \\npolicies taking into account all the prevailing socioeconomic conditions \\non the ground in different African countries. In this article, we system\\xad\\natically review a range of proven approaches or methods that can be \\n* Corresponding author at: Department of Information and Communication Sciences, Faculty of Science and Technology, Sophia University, Tokyo 102-8554, \\nJapan.\\nE-mail address: amena_mahmoud@sophia.ac.jp (A.

Crop yield prediction is a challenge for \\ndecision-makers at all levels, including global and local levels.

In particular, our\\napproach is less pessimistic in the warmest regions and the warmest scenarios.\\n1. Introduction\\nAnthropogenic climate change will affect the agricul-\\ntural sector more directly than many others because of\\nits direct dependence on weather (Porter et al 2013).\\nThe nature and magnitude of these impacts depends\\nboth on the evolution of the climate system, as well as\\nthe relationship between crop yields and weather. This\\npaper focuses on the latter—yield prediction from\\nweather. Accurate models mapping weather to crop\\nyields are important not only for projecting impacts to\\nagriculture, but also for projecting the impact of\\nclimate change on linked economic and environmen-\\ntal outcomes, and in turn for mitigation and adapta-\\ntion policy.\\nA substantial portion of the work of modeling\\nyield for the purpose of climate change impact\\nassessment relies on deterministic, biophysical crop',\n",
