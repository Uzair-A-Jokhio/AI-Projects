Despite this, \\nagriculture contributes a lot towards the GDP of several African nations \\nthereby employing many people. However, there are more frequent and \\nsevere droughts from floods and higher temperatures which pose serious \\nthreats to agricultural production and even food security in Africa [1,2].\\nThere have been many recent technological developments in artifi\\xad\\ncial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and the Internet of Things \\n(IoT) that are meant to address these problems. These new methods will \\ngreatly improve agricultural resilience through optimized resource \\nallocation as well as better decision-making. A case example is where AI \\nand machine learning get used in analyzing intricate data sets for \\npurposes of predicting climate impacts, field crop health monitoring, \\nand designing adaptive strategies [3,4]. This means that such tools \\nenable precision agriculture by offering real-time data collection and \\nmonitoring which significantly enhances productivity and sustainability \\n[5,6].

These challenges can be categorized into:\\n1.1. Limited digital literacy & expertise\\n• Many farmers lack the necessary skills to operate AI-driven systems, \\nIoT sensors, and geospatial mapping tools.\\n• There is a shortage of trained professionals to implement and \\nmaintain these technologies.\\n1.2. High cost of advanced technology\\n• The cost of IoT devices, AI-powered analytics, and smart irrigation \\nsystems is often beyond the reach of smallholder farmers.\\n• Limited access to affordable, locally available tech solutions further \\nrestricts adoption.\\n1.3. Data scarcity & poor data management\\n• AI and ML models require large datasets to make accurate pre\\xad\\ndictions, but limited historical agricultural data in Africa affects \\nmodel accuracy.\\n• Lack of digital record-keeping among farmers hinders AI’s predictive \\ncapabilities.\\n1.4. Poor internet connectivity & electricity supply\\n• AI-powered and IoT-based farming systems require stable internet \\nand consistent power supply, which are lacking in many rural areas.\\n• Unreliable electricity grids and costly alternative power sources (e. \\ng., solar) limit technological implementation.\\n1.5. Unpredictable weather patterns\\n• Climate change has led to erratic rainfall, prolonged droughts, and \\nextreme temperatures, affecting AI’s ability to predict yields \\naccurately.\\n• Many AI models rely on past data, which may not always account for \\nnew climate anomalies.\\nAlthough past research examined the integration of AI and IoT in the \\nagriculture sector, none has so far articulated an integrated framework \\nthat considers the socio-economic and infrastructural constraints in \\nAfrica. This work addresses this shortcoming by exploring and empha\\xad\\nsizing scalable solutions that overcome these barriers. This work is the \\nfirst of its kind to apply machine learning models in conjunction with \\ngeospatial technologies and IoT in agriculture. What sets this work apart \\nis the emphasis on African agriculture its infrastructure deficits and its \\nvast range of environmental disparities.\\n2. Related work\\nThere have been numerous studies on the application of AI in agri\\xad\\nculture, and their advantages, limitations, and prospects when com\\xad\\nbined with IoT or other related technologies. Here are some important \\nfindings from several studies discussing how these technologies can be \\napplied to address climate change impacts in Africa. Applications of AI \\nand Machine Learning – Mishra and Mishra [3] examine improvements \\nin yield prediction, optimization of irrigation, as well as disease dis\\xad\\ncovery as a form of lensing the transformative capability that AI has on \\nagriculture. For example, Aggarwal [1], explores neural network and \\ndeep learning models for complex data analysis aiding better agricul\\xad\\ntural yields.\\nIoT and Precision Agriculture: Patil et al. [5]; and Liang and Shah [6]\\ncarried out studies that showed the application of IoT can be used in \\nagriculture to engage in precision farming based on data-driven deci\\xad\\nsion-making processes as well as optimizing resources exploitation. \\nSimilarly, IoT has been applied to enhance sustainability through better \\ncrop management practices.\\nGeospatial Technologies and Remote Sensing: Nguyen et al. [7]; and \\nBouguerra et al. [8], present how remote sensing and geospatial tech\\xad\\nnologies are being integrated for this purpose of environmental moni\\xad\\ntoring. This, therefore, means that sustainable agricultural development \\nwill require correct datasets which lead to adaptable strategies.\\nThe Role of Geospatial Technology in Achieving SDGs: Magesa et al. \\n[10] researched how geospatial technology can be used to realize sus\\xad\\ntainable development goals whereas Pandey & Pandey [9] argued that \\nsustainability issues related to food security can be improved by using \\nthe above-mentioned technology. In addition, these researchers \\nemphasized an integrated approach where spatial data is combined with \\nother types of sources.\\nFuture Direction and Challenges in Qazi et al. [12] do a critical \\nassessment of smart agriculture enabled with IoTs with AI providing \\nsmart solutions thereby pointing out areas where challenges still exist \\nand whether or not there will be a future forecasted direction. Indeed, \\nthey also stressed again that scalable solutions should address issues of \\naccessibility to data along with infrastructure constraints.\\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have trans\\xad\\nformed agriculture by improving crop yield forecasts, optimizing irri\\xad\\ngation timetables, and identifying diseases. According to Mishra and \\nMishra [3], these two areas can revolutionize agriculture as they can use \\nbig data to make informed decisions about farming practices. Referring \\nto the work of Aggarwal [1], showed that neural networks and deep \\nlearning models have proven useful in enhancing production through \\ninformed insights about crop management. These investigations \\nunderscored that AI/ML is pivotal for modern farming, particularly in \\nareas facing climate change variability or extreme weather conditions.\\nPrecision agriculture is heavily dependent on the Internet of Things \\n(IoT), which allows real-time collection of data as well as monitoring of \\nthe environment. Patil et al. [5] focused on applications of IoT in pre\\xad\\ncision farming techniques that enable efficient resource use through \\ndata-driven decision-making. Liang and Shah [6] also discuss how IoT \\nbenefits agriculture for enhanced productivity and sustainability pur\\xad\\nposes. By integrating AI with IoT, precise agricultural practices would \\nhelp farmers manage crops better by solving climate change issues at the \\nsame time reducing waste.\\nRemote sensing, including other geospatial technologies, is impor\\xad\\ntant in comprehending changes in the environment and developing \\nadaptation strategies towards sustainable agriculture. In one of their \\nstudies, Nguyen et al. [7] provided a summary of the use of machine \\nlearning in conjunction with remote sensing for environmental moni\\xad\\ntoring purposes such as assessment of land use change. They demon\\xad\\nstrated how precise geospatial information can aid in the development \\nof resilient adaptive management strategies to enhance agricultural \\nproduction systems. Bouguerra et al. [8] used high-precision geospatial \\ndata to explore how maps that illustrate soil erosion vulnerability can be \\nemployed to indicate appropriate farming methods against adverse ef\\xad\\nfects caused by climate change.\\nAfrica, especially when faced with climate change, has to consider \\nsustainability and food security when planning for its future. Pandey and \\nPandey [9], explored how geospatial technology could be instrumental \\nin achieving this goal while at the same time increasing the productivity \\nof agriculture without causing harm to the environment. Magesa et al. \\n[10] looked into what factors influence the adoption of sustainable \\npractices among farmers in Africa; they however emphasized that \\nresilience and sustainability would be possible if targeted interventions \\nwere put in place. Consequently, it is necessary for integrated holistic \\nsolutions that merge other technologies with geographic data for sus\\xad\\ntainable agriculture purposes.\\nA.

In this regard, \\nQazi et al. [12] critically analyze the deployment of IoT-enabled and \\nAI-based smart agriculture to determine barriers that currently exist and \\nare expected to emerge in the future. The authors argue that there have \\nto be scalable approaches for challenges like unavailability of data, \\ninadequate infrastructure facilities, and lack of competencies among \\nstaff members. As such, overcoming these impediments requires \\ncollaborative ways as well as focused measures that take into consid\\xad\\neration individual socio-economic and environmental conditions within \\nAfrican nations.\\nMishra et al. (2023) have shown the capabilities in the deployment of \\nthe AI and ML techniques for terrain-performance intent forecasting and \\nirrigation cycles and found out that the use of neural networks and deep \\nlearning models can comprehend intricacies associated with big agri\\xad\\ncultural data. Nevertheless, their analysis is at the current devoid of \\nregional specificity for the African region, such as the infrastructural \\ndevelopment and socioeconomic issues that deter its use.\\nLiang and Shah (2023) mentioned their role as ‘decision makers’ \\nthrough the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices in precision \\nagriculture. They noted their findings as significant, however, their \\nstudy failed to combine the IoT devices with artificial intelligence or \\ngeospatial technologies which would have addressed the sophisticated \\nissues faced in agriculture.\\nNguyen et al. (2021) conducted a study on the use of machine \\nlearning and remote sensing for land cover dynamics and environmental \\nrisk assessments. Despite their appreciable use of the geospatial in\\xad\\nstruments of high accuracy, they admitted that their study was largely \\nenvironmental and did not cover agricultural resources management.\\nAccording to Qazi et al. [12], the deployment of IoT-enabled Smart \\nAgriculture systems faces challenges of data availability and infra\\xad\\nstructure challenges. We build on the research of Qazi et al. [12] as they \\nhighlighted the need to address scalability issues and provision of \\ninexpensive technologies for adoption in Africa. Nguyen et al. [7] have \\nelaborated on the use of remote sensing in environmental monitoring \\nbut have not addressed the combination of this with ML models in \\nagriculture. This work establishes the use of geospatial technologies \\ncoupled with AI models, CNNs, and reinforcement learning in maxi\\xad\\nmizing efficiency in land use and disease diagnosis. Unlike Liang and \\nShah (2023) who attempted to address IoT in agriculture from only the \\nperspective of IoT devices, this research extends the understanding of \\nhow IoT can be used in combination with AI and geospatial technologies \\nin order to optimize the processes involved in agricultural farming \\n(Table 1).\\n3. Materials and approaches\\nThis research aims to evaluate the suitability of different kinds of \\nmachine learning models for addressing climate change-related chal\\xad\\nlenges faced by the African agricultural sector. They have Linear \\nRegression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural \\nNetworks, Gradient Boosting, and Convolutional Neural Networks \\n(CNN). Every model has its peculiarities in order to predict crop yields \\nand detect diseases among crops under irrigation management or \\nresource optimization. The following are the details about models and \\ntheir mathematical expressions [13].\\nRandom forest was chosen for the estimation of crop yield owing to \\nits capability of processing high-dimensional data and capturing the \\nnon-linear interactions which are fundamental in analyzing sophisti\\xad\\ncated agricultural data sets. Convolutional Neural Nets (CNNs) were \\nused in disease detection, because of their advantage of being powerful \\nin interpreting complicated patterns, especially in images [14].\\nCNNs were utilized in disease identification due to their superior \\nimage recognition capabilities whereas, for predicting crop yield, the \\nneural network was employed owing to its ability to approximate \\nnonlinear functions effectively. Additionally, ensemble techniques such \\nas Gradient Boosting and Random Forest were incorporated in order to \\nenhance the reliability and precision of the models [15].\\n3.1. Data preprocessing\\n• Normalization: The two continuous variables, which are temperature \\nand rainfall were normalized between the range of values 0–1.\\n• Missing Value Segments Any missing information was replaced using \\nthe interpolation techniques of central value in order to minimize \\nbias.\\n• Feature Selection: To improve the model, certain features that had \\nlow variance or showed multicollinearity were omitted [16].\\n3.2. Optimization of parameters\\n• CNNs, Number of layers, Number of trees, depth filters which have a \\nmaximum of three to five layers, a max of 200 trees, and 50–50 max \\ndepths.\\n• Random Forest Optimizations: Learning Rate at ranges of 0.01–0.1 \\nand about average estimators gauged between 50 and 150. Hyper\\xad\\nparameters are set up with grid search and include cross-validation \\nwith five folds [17].\\n3.3. Linear regression\\nThe linear regression model is easy but robust to make predictions \\nabout a continuous dependent variable through one or more indepen\\xad\\ndent variable [18]s.

Some methods that have been explored for \\ncreating smart irrigation systems include decision tree models and \\nreinforcement learning.

Continuous feedback is learned \\nfrom, helping these models to optimize irrigation schedules for much \\nmore precise water usage and better crop performance on the one hand; \\non the other, however, the systems of smart watering that make oper\\xad\\national efficiency improvements are also experienced by neural \\nnetworks.\\nReinforcement Learning was the most efficient in terms of both water \\nand yield improvement with values of 25.4 % and 12.3 % which proves \\nits capability of being implemented in instances with dynamic irrigation \\nrequirements.

Here is my analysis of the \\nchart:\\nOn the radar graph, CNNs have the biggest area which means that \\nthey had the best performance across all metrics. It works very well with \\ntasks related to image recognition; therefore, it can be used to identify \\nand classify various plant diseases from images.\\nBoth Precision and Recall are high, indicating that CNNs can effec\\xad\\ntively detect true positives while reducing false positives.\\nRandom Forest also performed well, coming second after CNNs. This \\nmodel exhibits a good tradeoff between precision and recall for disease \\ndetection in situations where image data may be noisy or complex.\\nRandom Forest is an ensemble method with diverse pattern- \\ncapturing abilities that have contributed to its high accuracy together \\nwith the F1 score.\\nSVM performed at a level close to those of CNNs and Random Forest \\nbut slightly behind them. Its precision as well as accuracy are remark\\xad\\nable showing effectiveness in binary classification tasks within specific \\nmargin spaces.\\nHowever, SVM might perform badly when faced with more compli\\xad\\ncated datasets where direct linear separations cannot be obtained easily.\\nK-NN did just okay but it was not up to the mark like those sophis\\xad\\nticated ones (CNNs and Random Forest). This model is simple enough \\nand fits better where there are fewer dimensions or computational re\\xad\\nsources are scarce.\\nThe picture shows k-NN has a smaller area than any other models \\nmeaning inadequacy in terms of precision and recall compared to these \\nothers.\\nDecision Trees were ranked lowest among these assessed models due \\nto their simplicity as well as interpretability nature although they tend to \\noverfit thus low values for precision and recall shown by small areas on \\nthis chart.\\nBut Decision Trees would be useful in simpler, noise-free datasets \\nwhereas RF lacked stability, unlike other ensemble methods such as \\nRandom Forest.:\\nThis paper posits that CNNs are the most effective model for plant \\ndisease detection because of their ability to handle complex image data, \\nresulting in the highest scores for all metrics.\\nAnother option is Random Forest, which strikes a balance between \\ninterpretability and performance especially when dealing with datasets \\nthat are heterogeneous and complicated.\\nHowever, SVM and k-NN have some limitations when used for plant \\ndisease detection as compared to CNNs which can accommodate various \\nchallenges associated with the diseases.\\nAlso, Decision Trees might not be the best choice for intricate data\\xad\\nsets because they tend to overfit although in less complex scenarios, they \\nmay still give useful direction insights.\\nThe radar chart is an effective tool that outlines the strengths and \\nweaknesses of each model compared to others thus helping farmers \\nchoose what kind of machine-learning techniques will work better given \\nspecific agricultural needs or dataset types.\\n6.1.3.

These \\nmodels excel in identifying optimal resource allocation as they analyze \\ncomplex relationships that may exist between various agricultural in\\xad\\nputs and outputs. In addition, Gradient Boosting Machines and Rein\\xad\\nforcement Learning models displayed excellent performance indicating \\ntheir effectiveness in resource optimization.\\nThe study of neural networks achieved significant gains in resource \\noptimization which resulted in a 19.4 % reduction in fertilizer and a \\n16.2 % reduction in pesticide along with a land usage efficiency of \\n84.6 %. Close behind were Gradient Boosting and Re Reinforcement \\nLearning which were accomplishing reduction surpassing 17 percent. \\nHowever, linear regression was best able to achieve efficiency because it \\nhas been able to portray its incapacity in capturing intricate interactions \\namong different agricultural inputs.\\nThe bar graph shown in Fig. 15, provides information about how \\ndifferent machine learning models performed in optimizing irrigation \\nmanagement by concentrating on three key efficiency metrics-Water \\nSavings, Yield Improvement, and Operational Efficiency. Reinforce\\xad\\nment Learning had the highest water savings at around 25.4 % which \\nmeans the model was efficient in terms of optimizing irrigation sched\\xad\\nules through iterative feedback and learning. Random Forest and Neural \\nNetworks also resulted in significant savings of around 18.7 % and \\n22.8 % respectively thereby being suitable for applications where water \\nconservation is a priority.\\nOn the other hand, Decision Trees and SVM were able to save less \\nwater implying that they are not as good as the advanced methods for \\noptimization of irrigation strategies.

Enhanced resource optimization\\nTraditional farming methods often rely on experience-based deci\\xad\\nsion-making, which can lead to inefficient use of resources like water, \\nfertilizers, and pesticides.

Introduction \\nAgriculture is extremely important to the global economy. Understanding global crop yield is critical for resolving \\nfood security issues and mitigating the effects of climate change as the human population continues to grow. Crop \\nyield forecasting is a significant agricultural problem. Weather conditions (rain, temperature, etc.) and pesticides have \\na great impact on agricultural yield. It is important to have accurate knowledge about crop yield history while making \\ndecisions about agricultural risk management and yield forecasting [1]. Crop yield prediction is a challenge for \\ndecision-makers at all levels, including global and local levels. Farmers may adopt a good crop yield prediction model \\nto decide what to plant and when to plant it. Crop yield forecasting may be done in several ways [2] [3]. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n* Corresponding author.

It is a \\nsubdivision of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on learning. Machine learning (ML) can discover information \\nfrom datasets by identifying patterns and correlations. The models must be trained using datasets that represent prior \\nexperience-based outcomes [4]. The predictive model is built using a range of characteristics, and the parameters are \\ncalculated using previous data throughout the training phase. Some of the historical data that was not utilized for \\npreparation is used to measure results throughout the testing procedure. An ML model can be descriptive or predictive, \\ndepending on the research topic and questions. Predictive models use past knowledge to predict what will happen in \\nthe future. Descriptive templates, on the other hand, help to describe how things are now or what happened in the past. \\nMachine learning could help predict agricultural yields and decide which crops to sow and what to do during the \\ngrowing season. Several machine learning algorithms were deployed to enhance the agricultural yield forecast \\ninvestigation. Crop yields have lately been predicted using machine learning approaches such as multivariate \\nregression, decision trees, association rule mining, and artificial neural networks [5] [6].  \\nMachine learning models assume the output (crop yield) to be a non-linear function of the input variables (area and \\nenvironmental factors). Deep learning models for crop yield prediction have recently gained popularity [7]. Deep \\nlearning is a form of machine learning that can predict outcomes from a variety of raw data arrangements. Deep \\nlearning algorithms, for example, can build a probability model from ten years of field data and provide insights into \\ncrop output under various climatic conditions. Deep learning uses artificial neural networks (ANNs) to replicate how \\npeople think and learn. Artificial neural networks with several layers drive deep learning. DNNs (Deep Neural \\nNetworks) are multilayer networks that can execute complicated operations such as representation and abstraction to \\ngrasp pictures, sound, and text [8] [9] [10]. Neural networks are built up of layers of nodes, just like the human brain \\nis made up of neurons. Nodes in one layer are linked to nodes in another layer. The network's depth is indicated by the \\nnumber of layers. In an artificial neural network, signals travel between nodes and are assigned weights. The objective \\nof this research is to give a certain impetuous to more data-driven decision-making even to the agricultural section of \\nour country. However, the experience of an individual in this field is what matters the most, our aim is to aid this \\nthinking with our data-driven research and forecasting. In this research work, the authors predicted crop yield in \\nRajasthan state's 33 districts. The authors implemented four machine learning and one deep learning algorithm to \\ncompare the performance of models. The organization of the paper is as follows: first section of the article provides \\nthe introduction of the research; the second section describes methods implemented in the article along with the dataset \\nused to obtain the results; third section contains result and discussion on the results; and finally, the work has been \\nconcluded in last section of the article. \\n2.

After removing all invalid and null data, the dataset\\'s final shape is 3664 rows and 7 columns. \\nYield is now added as an independent variable. To obtain a more scientific result, a few more independent features are \\nadded to the dataset, including the soil type found in that district and the amount of rainfall that has occurred in these \\ndistricts over the years. The reason for selecting these specific factors is that first and foremost, the soil is one of the \\nmost important components of crop yield because it provides the crop with the necessary nutrients, water, and oxygen, \\nwhile rainfall patterns help in determining the amount of natural water that will be provided for crop growth, \\nreplenishment, and production. \\nThe type of soil that is unique to a particular district was identified. About 27 different types of soil have been \\nidentified in Rajasthan, and the soil in each of the current 32 districts is a mixture of any of these 27 types of soil. As \\none can see, each district has its unique combination of soil, and this information is presented in the form of categorical \\ndata. As a result, in order to perform prediction over the dataset, the soil data must be encoded, resulting in the creation \\nof dummy variables. The data frames were then combined, and the \"Soil Type\" column was removed from the original \\ndata frame. A concurrent change in the format in which the names of the districts have been represented is also required \\nfor a clear understanding of the dataset at hand. Following that, rainfall data was added to the dataset. The rainfall data \\nwere available for each district of Rajasthan from 1901 to 2002 and 2004 to 2010. The rainfall data corresponding to \\n2003 was filled by using the mean of the data available, and data for the years 2011 to 2017, was extracted from the \\nofficial documentation done by the Rajasthan Government. Following that, rainfall data for the years 2018 and 2019 \\nwere added using the mean of the data from 1901 to 2017. Because the main dataset contains crop production \\ninformation from 1997 to 2019, the final dataset contains monthly rainfall data for each district for the same period. \\nFinally, the rainfall dataset is merged with the main dataset. \\nEach crop has a distinct season in which it is harvested. As a result, considering the rainfall pattern for the entire \\nyear for that crop makes no sense. So, in order to calculate the correct amount of rainfall that the crop would have \\nreceived, the mean value of rainfall for the months corresponding to those seasons is used. Thus, rainfall received \\nduring July, August, September, and October is considered for crops produced during the Kharif season, while rainfall \\nreceived during November, December, January, February, and March is considered for crops produced during the Rabi \\nseason. The columns from January to Annual Total are then deleted. The column \"State\" is also removed because only \\nRajasthan is being considered, and the different districts act as distinguishing entities, so the presence of the \"State\" \\nvariable is unnecessary.  \\nTable 2 shows the data and source of the data. \\n     Table 2.

As a \\nresult, a dataset can be divided into two types of variables: continuous variables and categorical variables. A \\ncategorical variable takes one value from a limited set of values and is not quantifiable. As a result, to apply any \\nalgorithm, such variables must be encoded, because many machine learning algorithms cannot work directly on \\nlabelled data, so all input must be in the form of numeric values. There are several methods for encoding and \\nhandling such variables. LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder, and other methods fall into this category. Dummy \\nvariables were created from all the categorical data in the given dataset. Creating dummy variables gives flexibility \\nwhile performing regression analysis and hence suits well for the given dataset. \\n \\n• Standardization Of Features \\nThe DataFrame consists of 71 features. To get the desired output, standardization of these features is \\nimportant as it helps bring all the features into a single scale for much more accurate calculations. The \\nStandarScaler method from the SciKit Learn library has been applied to the given dataset. This helps standardize \\nfeatures by removing mean and scaling to unit variance. Standardization of any dataset is common practice and a \\nnecessity at times for a lot of machine learning and deep learning methodologies. \\n \\n• Splitting Dataset into Testing and Training Sets \\nThe final step of data preprocessing is testing and training the data. The division between the training and \\ntesting size of the data is not done equally. A larger training set is required as compared to the testing size, since, for \\nprediction, the model needs to be trained over as many data points as possible. For this, the ScikitLearn library and \\nimport of the train_test_split module is used. The train_test_split method has been used to split the data, with the test \\nset being 2% of the total dataset and the random state set to 71. These values give the most accurate possible result, \\ndue to the skewness of the dataset as well as its enormity of it. \\nPseudocode: \\ni. \\nImport the required libraries – Pandas, Numpy and SciKit Learn  \\nii. \\nSET df as pd.read_excel(\\'Rajasthan_Crop_Final.xlsx\\') \\niii. \\nDropping Onion, Maize and Pratapgarh district from the DataFram \\niv. \\nCalculate Yield as Production / Area \\nv. \\nAssigning Soil Type to the Districts \\nvi. \\nSET Soil as Empty List \\nvii. \\nfor x in District Name \\nviii. \\nIF x IS \"BARMER\" add \"Desert soils and sand dunes aeolian soil, coarse sand in texture some places \\ncalcareous\" to soil \\nix. \\nELSE IF x IS \"GANGANAGAR\" or \"HANUMANGARH\" add \"Alluvial deposites calcareous, high soluble \\nsalts & exchangeable sodium\" to the soil \\nx. \\nELSE IF x IS \"BIKANER\" or \"JAISALMER\" add \"Desert soils and sand dunes aeolian soil, loamycoarse in \\ntexture & calcareous\" to soil \\nxi. \\nELSE IF x IS \"NAGAUR\" or \"SIKAR\" or \"JHUNJHUNU\" add \"Sandy loam, sallow depth red soils in \\ndepressions\" to the soil \\nxii. \\nELSE IF x IS \"JALORE\" or \"PALI\" add \"Red desert soils\" to the soil \\nxiii. \\nELSE IF x IS \"JAIPUR\" or \"AJMER\" or \"DAUSA\" or \"TONK\" add \"Sierozens, eastern part alluvial, west-\\nnorth-west lithosols, foothills, brown soils\" to soil \\nxiv. \\nELSE IF x IS \"ALWAR\" or \"DHOLPUR\" or \"BHARATPUR\" or \"KARAULI\" or \"SAWAI MADHOPUR\" \\nadd \"Alluvial prone to water logging, nature of recently alluvial calcareous has been observed\" to soil \\nxv. \\nELSE IF x IS \"BHILWARA\" or \"RAJSAMAND\" add \"Soil is lithosolsat foot hills & alluvials in plains\" to \\nthe soil \\nxvi. \\nELSE IF x IS \"DUNGARPUR\" or \"BANSWARA\" add \"Predominantly reddish medium texture, well-\\ndrained calcareous, shallow on hills, deep soils in valleys\" to the soil \\nxvii. \\nELSE IF x IS \"KOTA\" or \"JHALAWAR\" or \"BUNDI\" or \"BARAN\" add \"Black of alluvial origin, clay \\nloam, groundwater salinity\" to the soil'),\n",

Models \\n• Random Forest \\nRandom forest is a very famous machine learning algorithm that felicitates in cases of both classification and \\nregression issues [11]. This algorithm works on the notion of ensemble learning, which works on the principle of \\nmerging several classifiers to give the solution for any complex problem and improve the precision and performance \\nof the applied model. Random Forest is a classifier that uses numerous decision trees on subsets of a dataset and takes \\nthe average into account to increase the dataset\\'s prediction accuracy. In other words, rather than depending on a single \\ndecision tree, this algorithm considers forecasts from each tree and predicts the ultimate result based on the majority \\nof votes.  \\n• Support Vector Machine (SVM) \\nThe goal of the support vector machine algorithm is to discover a hyperplane in N-dimensional space (N refers to the \\nnumber of features present in the dataset) that classifies the data points very distinctly. To detach the two classes of \\ninformation points, various possible hyperplanes could be chosen. To find a plane that has the best edge, i.e., the \\nhighest distance between data points of the two classes is dissected [12]. Extending the edge distance gives some help \\nso future data points can be organized with more assurance. To increase and maximize the edge between the data \\npoints and the hyperplane, the Hinge function is utilized: \\n \\n \\n                                                         𝑐𝑐(𝑥𝑥, 𝑦𝑦, 𝑓𝑓(𝑥𝑥)) = { 0, 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑦𝑦∗𝑓𝑓(𝑥𝑥) ≥1\\n1 −𝑦𝑦∗𝑓𝑓(𝑥𝑥),         𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒}                                                                (1)               \\nHinge loss function \\n \\nThe cost comes out to be 0 if the predicted value and the actual value are of the same sign, but if not, then the loss \\nvalue is calculated. To balance the regularized limits, the regularization function is added to the Hinge loss function: \\n \\n                                                              𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝜔𝜔λ ||𝜔𝜔||2 + ∑\\n(1 − 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖, 𝜔𝜔))+\\n𝑛𝑛\\n𝑖𝑖=1\\n                                                        (2)'),\n",

It finds the coefficients that minimize the cost function as far as possible by identifying a local minimum of \\nthe differentiable function. Gradient descent begins by characterizing the initial parameter values and then uses \\nanalytics and calculus to iteratively change the values so that they limit the given cost function. Gradient descent can \\nalso be defined as the slope of any given function [13]. The greater the gradient, the greater the slope, and thus the \\nfaster the model's learning rate. When the slope reaches zero, the model stops learning. Hence, one can argue that a \\ngradient is simply the partial derivate concerning the introduced values. The following equation describes what the \\ngiven algorithm does: \\n \\n \\n                                                                                           𝑏𝑏= 𝑎𝑎− 𝛾𝛾∇𝑓𝑓(𝑎𝑎)                                                                         (7) \\nb = next position, a = current position \\nThe negative sign denotes the minimization component of gradient descent, whereas the gamma denotes the waiting \\nfeature and the gradient term (Δf(a)) denotes the direction of the sharpest decrease. \\nIn a machine or deep learning model on applying the algorithm to minimize the cost function J (𝜔𝜔, 𝑏𝑏) and reaching \\nthe local minimum by tweaking the parameter it is observed that the gradient descent function is convex, but there do \\nexist non-convex examples as well, all depending upon the dataset \\n• Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) \\nLong short-term memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is capable of long-term \\ndependence. Neural networks are a collection of algorithms designed to mimic the human brain and find patterns. \\nRNN is simply a generalized feedforward neural network with internal memory [14]. RNN is recurrent in nature, as \\nthe name implies, and so performs the exact function for all data inputs, although the output of the current input is \\nsignificantly dependent on prior calculations. Unlike other standard feedforward neural organizations, LSTM has \\nfeedback connections [15]. It cannot only cycle single information points that are the data points, for example, pictures, \\nbut also the whole groupings of information, for example, discourse or video. Such a network is used to process and \\npredict problems involving time series and other complex problems such as this one. LSTM, being a modification of\"),\n",

This model is \\nparticularly useful and suits well for models that show high levels of multicollinearity as is the case in this particular \\ndataset. This algorithm executes L1 regularization, which adds a penalty that is equivalent to the absolute value of the \\ndegree of the coefficients [16]. Lasso solutions are quadratic programming problems, that use the following formula: \\n \\n                                             ∑\\n(𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖− ∑𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝛽𝛽𝑗𝑗)2 +  λ ∑\\n|𝛽𝛽𝑗𝑗|\\n𝑝𝑝\\n𝑗𝑗=1\\n \\n𝑗𝑗\\n𝑛𝑛\\n𝑖𝑖=1\\n                                                                   (8) \\n \\nThe intensity of the L1 penalty is controlled by a tuning parameter. Which is essentially the amount of shrinking. If it \\nis zero, then all features are taken into account, and it is equivalent to linear regression, in which just the residual sum \\nof squares is used to form a predictive model. If it is infinity, it means that no features are taken into account. The bias \\nincreases while the variance decreases with an increase in λ, and vice-versa. \\n3. Results and discussion \\nAccording to the analysis, even though there hasn't been a consistent rainfall pattern over the years (figure 1), crop \\nproduction has steadily increased, except Wheat and Jowar from 2016 to 2019, where there has been a sharp decrease \\nin rainfall patterns. This indicates a growing reliance on modern irrigation techniques for most crops, while water-\\nintensive crops like wheat and jowar continue to rely on natural water sources, primarily rain. \\nAfter examining each crop separately, it is possible to conclude: For Bajra, the area under irrigation used to produce \\nthis crop has more or less, hasn’t changed erratically (figure 2), i.e., from 1997-2019, and has been constant, with a \\ncertain dip between the years 2000-2003 due to reasons unknown, but the yield of this crop has seen a constant rise \\nbarring the year 2003 and 2009 (figure 3). This can be factored in due to better seasonal rainfall as well as the \\navailability of modern and ever-improving irrigation methods as well as better fertilizers, pesticides, and production \\ntechniques. For Wheat, the area under irrigation and production when plotted against the years, one can observe that \\nwhile there’s a drop in the area used from 1997-2003, the area started increasing gradually from there on till 2019 \\n(figure 4). Considering the yield, it has remained consistent over the years, with a certain boom in 2018 but a dip in \\n2019 for the state (figure 5). There can be several reasons for such an observation. One of them can be the growing \\nneed to produce for other parts of the country as well. For Rapeseed & Mustard, the area under irrigation used to \\nproduce the given crop has remained pretty much constant as shown by the graph, with a dip during 2000-2003 and a \\nhigh increase in from 2003-2005 and then becoming constant (figure 6). In the case of yield, over the years there has \\nbeen a gradual increase in the yield (figure 7) of this crop even though the area has been pretty much constant. This \\ncan be factored with the increase in demand and modernization of production and irrigation techniques of farming. \\nFor Barley, again as observed in the case of other crops, the area under production hasn’t increased as such (figure 8) \\nbut the yield over the years has been rising in this factor over the years (figure 9). For Jowar, the area has remained \\nalmost the same over the years (figure 10), which has been the case for most of the crops, but the production has yet \\nagain increased over the years (figure 11) as furthermore observed in the case with all the crops that have been grown \\nin the state of Rajasthan. \\nFrom these observations, the conclusion drawn is that area is something that has remained pretty much similar over \\nthe years, indicating that area is a very limited resource that cannot be increased since land is required for several other \\npurposes. But due to the increase in population, the demand has also been constantly increasing, so to meet these \\ndemands, production needs to be increased, which has been the case over the years. But, since the area hasn't altered \\nmuch for most crops, the rise in the yield implies that the modern methods of irrigation and production and the use of \\nbetter fertilizers and other modernized methods have resulted in a better yield of these particular crops.\"),\n",

Yield vs Year (Jowar). \\nThe r2 score, MAE (Mean Average Error), and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) have been chosen to assess the \\naccuracy of the models deployed.  \\nExcept for LSTM, the dataset has been divided into a ratio of 98 percent training and 2% testing, with a random \\nstate set at 71. For LSTM, a ratio of 99 percent training set to 1% test set with the same value for the random state was \\nused. Two separate analyses were carried out, the first using only area, production, year, and district as independent \\nfeatures for yield prediction, and the second including the mean seasonal rainfall as well as the soil type of the specific \\ndistrict to understand the effect of these variables on yield. Following an analysis of the results for each model \\nindividually, the following observations were made: \\nIn the case of the Random Forest algorithm, the R2 score is the highest, thus, it has higher accuracy when compared \\nto other models for both cases, and that is about 97% in the case of selected parameters and about 96.3% in case of all \\nparameters (figure 12). The RMSE for the selected parameters is about 3.2% and the MAE score is about 2.1%, in the \\ncase of all parameters, the RMSE is 3.5% and MAE is 2.5%. In the case of the Support Vector Machine or commonly \\nreferred to as the SVM algorithm, the R2 score is 90.3% when considering the selected factors (figure 13), and for all \\nfactors considered the score is about 89.8%. For the selected parameters the RMSE is 5.8% and MAE is 4.74%, in the \\ncase of all parameters the RMSE is 5.9% and MAE is 4.78%. In the case of the Lasso Regression algorithm, the R2 \\nscore is 79.2% in the case of selected parameters and in the case of all parameters it is 81.4% (figure 14). The RMSE \\nis 8.5% and MAE is 6.2% in the case of selected parameters while RMSE is 8.06% and MAE is 5.8% in the case of \\nall parameters. In the case of the Gradient Descent algorithm, the R2 score is 67.2% for selected parameters, while on \\nthe dataset with all the parameters the score is 73.7% (figure 15). For the RMSE and MAE values for the selected \\nparameters dataset, the values are 10.7% and 8.8% respectively. In the case of the dataset with all the parameters, the \\nvalues are RMSE as 9.6% and MAE as 7.9%. In the case of the Long Short-Term Memory or commonly known as \\nthe LSTM algorithms, when this model is applied to both types of the dataset, the R2 score is 76.05%, RMSE is 49.8% \\nand MAE is 41.2% for the dataset with selected parameters (figure 16). While in the case of all parameters the R2 \\nscore is 75.7%, RMSE is 50.1% and MAE is 41.6%. Same parameters have been used for all the models while splitting \\ninto training and testing sets to get the best possible accuracy, but in the case of LSTM since the algorithm in general \\nworks best and requires a larger database than what is being provided, the testing set has been reduced by 1%. This \\nprovided a higher accuracy when applied to the dataset. \\n \\n \\nFig. 12. Model performance of Random Forest.'),\n",

Most \\nmodels' accuracy decreases when the scientific parameters of soil and mean rainfall are added, but here the scenario \\nis the opposite in models like Lasso Regression and Gradient Descent. Although the STM model has a higher R2 score \\nthan the Gradient Descent algorithm, the RMSE and MAE values are also very high, which is not a good sign for any \\npredictive model. Since the dataset is based on actual data as provided by the official Government of Rajasthan \\nwebsite, the accuracy based on tested data points, shows that creating a data-driven predictive model can boost and \\nmaximize the yield for almost all the crops. This can help in the growth of the agricultural economy when mixed with \\nthe know-how and experience of the farmers. \\n4. Conclusion \\nBased on all of the discussions and analyses, it is clear that the machine learning models used - Random Forest, \\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM), and Lasso Regression - outperform the deep learning models used - Gradient Descent \\nand Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) - in terms of accuracy. This could be because, when compared to other models, \\nmodels like LSTM require a larger quantum of data for a better predictive analysis. Furthermore, based on the \\nobservations, most of the models perform better on the specified parameters, whereas models such as Gradient Descent \\nand Lasso Regression perform better when applied to the dataset with all of the characteristics. While soil and rainfall \\nquantity are important in crop production and general farming, it can be concluded that a deeper investigation of these \\nelements, as well as a larger database, is required for real-life research of such elements using prediction models. \\nFinally, it can be concluded that the Random Forest algorithm outperforms all other models when applied to any of \\nthe datasets. \\n The current research can be extended into performing further analysis and forecasting the factors that influence \\ncrop yield. A larger dataset and more historically accurate data about the environment and weather during each crop \\nyear is required to identify best performing model between deep learning and machine learning models. To find the \\nbest-performing technique, more deep learning models need to be tested on the dataset. In the field of crop yield \\nprediction, remote sensing data could be merged with the district-level statistical data to improve the model's \\nperformance.   \\nReferences \\n[1] Kavita, Ms, and Pratistha Mathur.

A growing empirical literature models this\\nrelationship in order to project climate change impacts on the sector. We describe an approach to yield\\nmodeling that uses a semiparametric variant of a deep neural network, which can simultaneously\\naccount for complex nonlinear relationships in high-dimensional datasets, as well as known\\nparametric structure and unobserved cross-sectional heterogeneity. Using data on corn yield from the\\nUS Midwest, we show that this approach outperforms both classical statistical methods and fully-\\nnonparametric neural networks in predicting yields of years withheld during model training. Using\\nscenarios from a suite of climate models, we show large negative impacts of climate change on corn\\nyield, but less severe than impacts projected using classical statistical methods. In particular, our\\napproach is less pessimistic in the warmest regions and the warmest scenarios.\\n1. Introduction\\nAnthropogenic climate change will affect the agricul-\\ntural sector more directly than many others because of\\nits direct dependence on weather (Porter et al 2013).\\nThe nature and magnitude of these impacts depends\\nboth on the evolution of the climate system, as well as\\nthe relationship between crop yields and weather. This\\npaper focuses on the latter—yield prediction from\\nweather. Accurate models mapping weather to crop\\nyields are important not only for projecting impacts to\\nagriculture, but also for projecting the impact of\\nclimate change on linked economic and environmen-\\ntal outcomes, and in turn for mitigation and adapta-\\ntion policy.\\nA substantial portion of the work of modeling\\nyield for the purpose of climate change impact\\nassessment relies on deterministic, biophysical crop\\nmodels (e.g. Rosenzweig et al 2013). These models\\nare based on detailed representations of plant phy-\\nsiology and remain important, particularly for asses-\\nsing response mechanisms and adaptation options\\n(Ciscar et al 2018). However, they are generally out-\\nperformed by statistical models in prediction over\\nlarger spatial scales (Lobell and Burke 2010, Lobell\\nand Asseng 2017).

Neural nets and semiparametric neural nets\\nArtiﬁcial neural networks—ﬁrst proposed in the\\n1950s Rosenblatt (1958)—employ a form of represen-\\ntation learning (Bengio et al 2013). Input data—here in\\nthe form of raw daily weather data with high dimen-\\nsion and little direct correlation with the outcome—\\nare progressively formed into more abstract and\\nultimately useful data aggregates. These are then\\nrelated to an outcome of interest (ﬁgure 1). Impor-\\ntantly, these aggregates are not pre-speciﬁed, but\\nrather they are discovered by the algorithm in the\\nprocess of training the network. It is the depth of the\\nsuccessive\\nlayers\\nof\\naggregation\\nand\\nincreasing\\nabstraction that give rise to the term ‘deep learning’\\n(LeCun et al 2015).\\nA basic neural network can be deﬁned by\\nequation (2):\\n\\uf0f2\\ng\\ng\\ng\\ng\\nG\\nG\\nG\\n=\\n+\\nG +\\n=\\n+\\n=\\n+\\n=\\n+\\n\\uf04d\\n(\\n)\\n(\\n)\\n(\\n)\\n( )\\ny\\na\\na\\na\\nV\\nV\\nV\\nV\\nV\\nV\\nZ\\n.\\n2\\nL\\nL\\nL\\n1\\n1 1\\n1\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n3\\n3\\n3\\nTerms Vl are derived variables (or ‘nodes’) at the\\nlth layer.

In addition to\\nweather data, we use county-level soil data, taken from\\nthe Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) Database (Soil\\nSurvey Staff 2017). This dataset comprises 39 mea-\\nsures of soil physical and chemical properties.\\nA complete description of the modeling approach\\nis in the methods section, below. We make use of boot-\\nstrap aggregation, or ‘bagging’ (Breiman 1996) to both\\nreduce the variance of predictions and to estimate out-\\nof sample prediction error. Models (1) and (3) are ﬁt to\\n96 bootstrap samples of unique years in our dataset,\\nand error is assessed as the average of the years not in\\nthe bootstrap sample.\\n4. Results\\n4.1. Predictive skill\\nWe begin by comparing the accuracy of the various\\napproaches in predicting yields in years that were not\\nused to train the model; table 2. The accuracy of the\\nparametric model and the SNN was substantially\\nimproved by bagging, but the bagged SNN performed\\nbest. The fully-nonparametric neural net—which was\\ntrained identically to the SNN but lacked parametric\\nterms—performed substantially worse then either the\\nOLS regression or the SNN.\\nThat bagging improves model ﬁt—of both the\\nOLS regression and the SNN—implies that certain\\nyears may have served as statistical leverage points, and\\nas such that un-bagged yield models may overﬁt the\\ndata. This is because there are too few distinct years of\\ndata to determine whether the heat of an anomalously\\nhot year is in fact the cause of that year’s anomalously\\nlow yields. If bootstrap samples that omit such years\\nestimate different relationships, then averaging such\\nestimates will reduce the inﬂuence of such outliers.\\nThat the SNN and the OLS regression both sub-\\nstantially out-perform the fully-nonparametric neural\\nnet is simply reﬂective of the general fact that para-\\nmetric models are more efﬁcient than nonparametric\\nmodels, to the degree that they are correctly speciﬁed.\\nThat the SNN is more accurate than the OLS regres-\\nsion—but not wildly so—implies that model (1) is a\\nuseful but imperfect approximation of the true under-\\nlying data-generating process.\\nThe spatial distribution of out-of-sample pre-\\ndictive skill—averaged over all years—is mapped in\\nthe online supplementary material at stacks.iop.org/\\nERL/13/114003/mmedia.\\n4.2. Variable importance\\nIt can be desirable to determine which variables and\\ngroups of variables contribute most to predictive skill.\\nImportance measures were developed in the context of\\nrandom forests (Breiman 2001). Applied to bagged\\nestimators, these statistics measure the decline in\\naccuracy when a variable or set of variables in the out-\\nof-bag sample is randomly permuted. Random per-\\nmutation destroys their correlation with the outcome\\nand with variables with which they interact, rendering\\nthem uninformative. We compute these measures for\\neach set of variables as the average MSE difference\\nacross ﬁve random permutations.\\nThese are plotted in ﬁgure 2. Of the daily weather\\nvariables, those measured in mid-summer are most\\nimportant by this measure, particularly daily pre-\\ncipitation and minimum relative humidity during the\\nwarmest part of the year. The later is consistent with\\nﬁndings of Anderson et al (2015) and Lobell et al\\n(2013), who show that one of the main mechanisms by\\nwhich high temperatures affect yield is through their\\ninﬂuence on water demand.\\nThe parametric portion of the model is more\\nimportant than the nonparametric part of the model\\n(ﬁgure 2, right)—mostly through the incorporation of\\nparametric time trends, but also through GDD. The\\nnonparametric component of the model—taken as a\\nwhole—is less important than the parametric repre-\\nsentation of GDD, though nonetheless responsible for\\nthe improvement in predictive skill over the baseline\\nOLS regression. However, the predictive power of the\\ntime-varying temperature variables lends support to\\nthe ﬁndings of Ortiz-Bobea (2013), who notes that\\nthere is room for improvement in the additive separ-\\nability approximation implicit in the baseline para-\\nmetric speciﬁcation. Soil variables, proportion of land\\nirrigated, and geographic coordinates have low impor-\\ntance values. It is possible that these variables would be\\nmore important in a model trained over a larger, less\\nhomogeneous area—allowing them to moderate and\\nlocalize the effects of daily weather variables. The cen-\\ntrality oftimetrendstopredictiveskill explains the poor\\nperformanceofthe fully-nonparametric neuralnet.\\n4.3. Projections\\nProjections for the periods 2040–2069 and 2070–2099,\\nfor both RCPs and all climate models, are reported in\\nﬁgure 3. Plotted conﬁdence intervals are derived by\\nTable 2.

Omission of these factors is likely\\nto bias statistical projections downwards, to the degree\\nthat these factors will increase expected yields, though\\nwe note that recent research raises uncertainty about\\nthe magnitude or existence of the CO2 fertilization\\neffect (Obermeier etal2018).\\nWhile there is little difference between the models\\nin scenarios in which yields decline less, the SNN pro-\\njects substantially less-severe impacts in scenarios\\nwhere yields decline the most across all models,\\nincluding most of the models in 2070–99 under\\nRCP8.5. Notably, the bagged OLS speciﬁcation is\\nnearly always less pessimistic than the standard OLS\\nmodel. It is likely that the pessimism of OLS relative to\\nbagged OLS derives from a relatively small number of\\nsevere years in the historical period affecting model\\nestimates by serving as outliers, in a manner which is\\ndiluted by the bootstrap aggregation process.\\nFigure 4 plots—for each model and scenario—the\\ndifference between average SNN and OLS projections,\\nagainst a suite of variables summarizing the climate\\nprojections.

Discussion\\nOn average, yield impacts projected by the neural net\\n—in response to future weather scenarios simulated\\nby global climate models—are somewhat less severe\\nthan those projected using parametric models. None-\\ntheless, these estimates are still among the more severe\\nestimates for temperate-zone corn compared to the\\nstudies compiled for the IPCC 5th Assessment Report\\n(Porter et al 2013). It is worth emphasizing that the\\ndifference in yield projections between the statistical\\napproaches considered here is not as large as the\\ndifference in yield projections between climate models\\nand emissions scenarios.\\nWe ﬁnd that the timing of heat and moisture are\\nimportant to predicting corn yields, along with the\\nsimple accumulation of heat. This is seen both in the\\nless-pessimistic projections in the south of our study\\narea, and the lack of positive responses to increasing\\nwarmth in the north of our study area. As such, we ﬁnd\\nthat GDDs are a useful but imperfect proxy for the role\\nof heat in predicting crop yield. Indeed, work has indi-\\ncated important roles for VPD and soil moisture\\n(Roberts et al 2012, Lobell et al 2013, Anderson\\net al 2015, Urban et al 2015) in explaining and building\\nupon the baseline parametric speciﬁcation. The com-\\nplexity of these underlying response mechanisms is an\\nargument for the explicit use of GCMs in assessing cli-\\nmate change impacts on agriculture, which explicitly\\ncapture the co-evolution of multiple climate variables.\\nWhile deep learning has led to substantial break-\\nthroughs in predictive applications and artiﬁcial intel-\\nligence, classical statistical methods will remain\\ncentral to scientiﬁc applications that seek to elucidate\\nmechanisms governing cause and effect. We describe a\\nsemiparametric approach that fuses the two and works\\nbetter than either alone in terms of predictive perfor-\\nmance. This approach is suitable for any prediction\\nproblem in which there is some—potentially imper-\\nfect—prior knowledge about the functions mapping\\ninputs to outcomes, and longitudinal or other struc-\\nture in the data.\\nUltimately, we ﬁnd that combining ML with\\ndomain-area\\nknowledge\\nfrom\\nempirical\\nstudies\\nimproves predictive skill, while altering conclusions\\nabout climate change impacts to agriculture. There is\\nsubstantial scope to reﬁne and extend this work, along\\nfour major avenues: (1) better representations of\\ndomain-area knowledge in the parameterization of the\\nparametric component of the model, (2) extension to\\nwider geographic areas, which will require more-\\nexplicit treatment of differences in seasonality of pro-\\nduction over space, (3) bringing the nonparametric\\n(neural network) part of the model closer to the\\nresearch frontier in ML and artiﬁcial intelligence, and\\n(4) ﬁnding ways to integrate elements from determi-\\nnistic crop models that have heretofore been challen-\\nging to model statistically, such as CO2 fertilization.\\n6. Methods\\nThe panelNNET R package (See footnote 2) was used\\nto train SNN used in this analysis. Key features of this\\npackage are described below.\\n6.1. Training Semiparametric Neural Networks\\nThere no closed form solution for a parameter set that\\nminimizes the loss function of a neural network;\\ntraining is done by gradient descent. This is compli-\\ncated by the fact that neural nets have many para-\\nmeters—it is common to build and train networks\\nwith more parameters than data. As such, neural\\nnetworks do not generally have unique solutions, and\\nregularization is essential to arriving at a useful\\nsolution—one that predicts well out-of-sample. This\\nsection describes basic ways that this is accomplished\\nin the context of semiparametric neural nets.\\nOur training algorithm seeks a parameter set that\\nminimizes the L2-penalized loss function\\nFigure 5.

In response, a number of approaches have been\\ndeveloped to dynamically alter the rate at which each\\nparameter is updated, in order to speed movement\\nalong plateaus and away from saddlepoints.

Where past gradients\\nwere low—perhaps because of a wide plateau in the\\nloss surface—the step size is divided by a very small\\nnumber, increasing it. See Ruder (2016) for an over-\\nview of gradient descent algorithms.\\nRather than computing the gradients at each step\\nwith the full dataset, it is typically advantageous to do\\nso with small randomized subsets of the data—a tech-\\nnique termed ‘minibatch’ gradient descent. One set of\\nminibatches comprising the whole of the dataset is\\ntermed one ‘epoch.’ Doing so speeds computation,\\nwhile introducing noise and thereby helping the opti-\\nmizer to avoid small local minima in the loss surface.\\nAnother technique used to improve the training of\\nneural networks is ‘dropout’ (Srivastava et al 2014).\\nThis technique randomly drops some proportion of\\nthe parameters at each layer, during each iteration of\\nthe network, and updates are computed only for the\\nweights that remain. Doing so prevents ‘co-adapta-\\ntion’ of parameters in the network—development of\\nstrong correlations between derived variables that ulti-\\nmately reduces their capacity to convey information to\\nsubsequent layers.\\n6.2. The ‘OLS trick’\\nWhile gradient descent methods generally perform\\nwell, they are inexact. The top level of a neural network\\nis a linear model however, in derived regressors in the\\ntypical context or in a mixture of derived regressors\\nand parametric terms in our semiparametric context.\\nOrdinary least squares provides a closed-form solution\\nfor the parameter vector that minimizes the unpena-\\nlized loss function, given a set of derived regressors,\\nwhile ridge regression provides an equivalent solution\\nfor the penalized case.\\nWe begin by noting that the loss function\\n(equation (4)) can be recast as\\n\\uf084\\nq q\\n-\\nq\\n(\\nˆ)\\nˆ ˆ\\ny\\ny\\nc\\nargmin\\ns.t.\\nT\\n2\\nas such, a given λ implies a ‘budget’ for deviation from\\nzero within elements of qˆ.

We do so\\niteratively—beginning with random draws from a dis-\\ntribution of hyperparameters, we ﬁt the model several\\ntimes using these draws in order to create a joint dis-\\ntribution of hyperparameters and test-set perfor-\\nmance.

Introduction\\nAccurate wheat-yield projections are critical for sustaining agricultural practices and\\nreducing the negative effects of climate change. Unlike prior studies, which mostly use\\ntraditional statistical methods, our research incorporates powerful machine learning algo-\\nrithms to forecast wheat yield under various climate change scenarios [1]. Wheat is a vital\\ncereal grain source, providing food for approximately 40% of the world’s population [2,3].\\nMost farmers, particularly those in developing nations, depend exclusively on their limited\\nknowledge and prior experience. This limited knowledge makes it challenging for them\\nto compete globally and fulfill expanding demands [4]. This study employs cutting-edge\\ntools to investigate the complex interaction between climate conditions and wheat yield,\\nproviding more precise and useful findings.\\nExtreme weather, changing trends of rainfall, and rising temperatures are all things\\nthat could hurt food security and agriculture production. Uncertainty about the weather\\nmakes it hard to predict wheat yields, which are very important. Things like frost during\\nthe flowering and grain-filling stages, temperatures above 30 °C, and not enough rain at\\nkey times can all lead to production losses [5]. These problems already exist, and climate\\nchange will only make them worse. This will make it harder to plan and handle crops well.\\nThe climate, management techniques, and personal standards can all affect the growth\\nof a crop. Researchers use process-based and statistical methods, such as biological data\\nand remote sensing [6–8], to keep an eye on production. Process-based models can be\\nused for certain crops, like rice, wheat, and corn, to help with resource management and\\nagriculture growth [9]. These models use correct data and algorithms to give farmers\\ninformation that helps them make smart decisions. Statistical methods can also predict\\nresults in a wide range of situations by looking at how weather and land quality are linked\\nto crops. Classical statistical methods based on mathematical models are often used to\\ntest ideas with crop samples. Their success, however, depends on having easy access to\\nrelevant farming data [10].\\nGlobal climate models (GCMs) are mostly used to guess how much food will be grown\\naround the world in different weather and management situations. The best way to find\\nout how climate change will affect crop growth is to use a GCM. GCMs have been used\\nto model weather, land, management, and other aspects of agricultural development in\\norder to predict food growth and output on a global and regional level. Different parts\\nof the world have different weather, land, and ways of growing. Peng (2023) says that\\nGCMs usually have a spatial resolution of 50 km × 50 km, which is good enough to obtain\\na good idea of national farming results. By adding these area factors, downscaling makes it\\npossible to make more accurate and reliable estimates of crop yields. As Zhang (2019) says,\\nthe Coupled Model Intercomparison Phase 3 (CMIP3) collects GCM data from various\\nsources to look into trends of climate change now and in the future. Using crop models and\\nhigh-resolution climate data together, machine learning-based downscaling helps look at\\nhow climate change affects farming in specific areas. This study gives us useful information\\nabout how to change.\\nIt is important to keep an eye on weather conditions like air temperature, CO2, rainfall,\\nand growing times when you are trying to adapt to a changing climate. Many studies have\\nbeen conducted around the world to look at how climate change affects the output of crops.\\nTo show how climate change affects crop yields, Reference [11] used techniques for increasing\\nyields that were part of the CMIP5 plan. As for Ishaque et al. [12], one way Pakistan might be\\nable to change would be to move the best times to plant wheat to cooler months.\\nUsing machine learning to fix problems has shown a lot of promise [13,14]. They\\nare able to work with data that have a lot of dimensions, find relationships that are not\\nstraight, and see complex trends [15]. ML algorithms find links between dependent and'),\n",

Machine learning techniques have been used in a number of ways to\\nidentify crops and predict their yields.\\nML algorithms help with planning and running farms, and they are often used to guess\\nhow much food crops will produce. Models like artificial neural networks (ANNs), multiple\\nlinear regression (MLR) [16], random forest regression (RFR) [13,17], and XGboost [18]\\nare used to estimate yields. These models consider things like temperature, humidity,\\nwind speed, rainfall, and atmospheric gases. Overfitting is a problem with these models,\\nwhich makes them less useful even when they do a good job of dealing with climate-\\nrelated problems in agriculture. Using ensemble methods with multiple models makes\\nyield predicting more accurate while reducing overfitting [19,20]. Ensemble methods, such\\nas meta-machine learning, may improve the accuracy of wheat growth predictions by\\ncombining the results of many models.\\nWhen it comes to predicting climate change, statistical models and old methods that\\nare based on past data often fall short. We suggest that this gap be filled by teaching\\na machine-learning model to predict wheat yields even when weather trends change.\\nMachine learning algorithms may use enormous datasets to learn complicated correlations\\nbetween variables and produce accurate predictions. The proposed solution integrates\\nweather station data and CO2 future emission scenarios to develop a precise machine-\\nlearning model capable of forecasting wheat yields. By accounting for climate change\\nimpacts on crop yields, our model empowers farmers to adapt their practices. The expected\\noutcome is improved prediction accuracy, enhancing wheat production and food security.\\nSimilar studies using analogous methodologies have been conducted in other countries\\nfor different crops [21]. However, they did not use ensemble models, exposing a gap\\nour research seeks to remedy. Our research stands out by combining ensemble modeling\\ntechniques, which aim to increase the robustness and accuracy of crop-yield projections.\\nSeveral studies have focused on forecasting crop production, especially in Pakistan,\\nutilizing various predictors like rainfall, fertilizer, temperature, tractors, and labor. Previous\\nresearch has highlighted the significant correlation between fertilizer application, remote\\nsensing techniques, and wheat output [22–25].\\nMore comprehensive studies that integrate multiple machine learning models specif-\\nically for wheat-yield prediction under climate change scenarios need to be conducted.\\nWhile individual models have been explored, ensemble techniques that incorporate the\\nadvantages of many algorithms are required to improve forecast accuracy. Unlike pre-\\nvious studies that primarily relied on traditional statistical methods or focused on other\\nregions [26], this work presents a novel way to predict wheat yield under climate change\\nscenarios that employs a complex ensemble of machine learning models. The fundamental\\nnovelty of this research is the integration of many advanced machine learning algorithms\\nto estimate wheat output based on climate data, which involves utilizing historical climate\\ndata as well as projections from GCMs. our research uniquely combines historical climate\\ndata, global climate model (GCM) projections, and advanced machine learning techniques.\\nBy doing so, we provide a comprehensive and accurate forecast of wheat yields specifically\\nfor Punjab, Pakistan. Our interdisciplinary approach advances agricultural yield predic-\\ntion and offers practical insights for developing climate-resilient farming practices. These\\nstudies aim to enhance crop-forecasting accuracy by analyzing different factors’ effects on\\nagriculture productivity, especially wheat production in Pakistan.\\nThe key objective of this study is to construct a model for forecasting wheat yields via\\nANNs using meteorological and GCM data.

Data Processing\\nThe methodology for data preprocessing and crop-yield projections involved several\\nkey steps. Data were gathered from various sources, processed, and used to calibrate\\nmodels and validate results. To provide robust analysis, missing or irregular values must\\nbe addressed carefully.\\nFirstly, daily historical weather data, including maximum and minimum temperature\\nand rainfall, was collected from a weather database [28]. Following the validation of the\\ndaily climatic data, several quality checks were carried out to assure reliability. These checks\\nincluded data validation against preset acceptable ranges, logical sequence consistency\\ntests (for example, temperature consistency), interpolation to handle missing data, and\\nremoving duplicate records. To manage missing data, linear interpolation was utilized,\\nwith each missing value estimated by averaging the values before and after it. To maintain\\ndata integrity, duplicate records were identified, and only the first instance of each duplicate\\nentry was retained. This was then aggregated into monthly averages to match the timelines\\nof the future estimates. The processed historical monthly climate datasets were combined\\ninto a single Excel file with pertinent modeling inputs and transformed into annual averages.\\nThe time series data yielded a uniform length of 31 years of records for each region.\\nThe climate-prediction data utilized in this study were obtained from GCM AR4 for\\nthree future emissions scenarios: SRA2, B1, and A1B. The data were originally stored\\nin netCDF format and must be preprocessed before analysis. We used Google Colab\\n(Python) to convert the netCDF files to comma-separated values (.csv) for easy use in\\nspreadsheet tools. As a result, Excel’s filtering tools allow us to reduce our focus to certain\\ngeographic places relevant to our research. Detailed documentation and metadata are\\ncritical for cooperation, comprehension, and validation. LAT and LONG filters were used\\nto separate the study areas from the data. At first, the numbers were shown as monthly\\nmeans over 20 or 30 years. Before making predictions about the average temperatures and\\namounts of rain and snow from 2022 to 2052, we changed them to yearly means.\\nThe original GCM data were in Kelvin, but our history data are in degrees Celsius\\n(◦C), so we changed them. We need to change information so that they are consistent with\\neach other so that we can make useful comparisons. Also, to match previous records, the\\namount of rain was changed from kg/m2/h to mm. The suggested ensemble forecasting\\nmethod used both estimates about the future and data from the past to give a more accurate\\npicture of how climate affects wheat yields. This method helps us understand seasonal\\nchanges and long-term climate trends better by focusing on bigger patterns instead of small\\nchanges that happen every day. This method could help farmers and farming groups make\\nbetter decisions.\\nData Splitting\\nML models are less likely to be biased when datasets are split up.

The ANN models were developed using the Keras library in Python (specifically,\\nGoogle Colab) with the Adam optimizer, binary cross-entropy loss, and varying numbers\\nof hidden layers (10–7).

The boosted tree models were\\ndeveloped with maximum depth (from 10 to 90), learning rate (0.01), number of estimators\\n(ranging from 100 to 1500), and 8-fold cross-validation. RFR model was built using maxi-\\nmum depth ranging from 10 to 90, several estimators of 80, and cross-validation of 8-fold.\\nA GFF model was created using dense layers of (100, 92, 1) for the ANN. We used ’relu’\\nactivation, ’adam’ optimizer, and ’lbfgs’ solver for training in Keras.\\nLastly, a stacking ensemble model was created for training using the weighted average\\nof the base models in sci-kit-learn. Final model evaluation was conducted on the unseen\\ntesting dataset, using performance metrics such as mean absolute error, root mean squared\\nerror, R2, normalized root mean square error, mean biased error, and correlation coefficient\\nto select the optimal hyperparameters for each algorithm. Regression graphs are generated\\nusing the matplotlib library in Google Colab to visualize the performance of all models.\\nThe coarse resolution is downscaled by three GCM outputs from CMIP3 using the\\nXGboost algorithm to project yields under future climates. XGboost was trained on 60%\\nof the weather data for parameter tuning, validated on 20%, and tested on the remaining\\n20% to map large-scale climate variables to local observations.

This research uses advanced machine learning models to explore the intricate relationship between climate change and wheat-yield prediction. Machine learning models used include multiple linear regression (MLR), boosted tree, random forest, ensemble models, and several types of ANNs: ANN (multi-layer perceptron), ANN (probabilistic neural network), ANN (generalized feed-forward), and ANN (linear regression). The model was evaluated and validated against yield and weather data from three Punjab, Pakistan, regions (1991–2021). The calibrated yield response model used downscaled global climate model (GCM) outputs for the SRA2, B1, and A1B average collective CO2 emissions scenarios to anticipate yield changes through 2052. Results showed that maximum temperature (R = 0.116) was the primary climate factor affecting wheat yield in Punjab, preceding the Tmin (R = 0.114), while rainfall had a negligible impact (R = 0.000). The ensemble model (R = 0.988, nRMSE= 8.0%, MAE = 0.090) demonstrated outstanding yield performance, outperforming Random Forest Regression (R = 0.909, nRMSE = 18%, MAE = 0.182), ANN(MLP) (R = 0.902, MAE = 0.238, nRMSE = 17.0%), and boosting tree (R = 0.902, nRMSE = 20%, MAE = 0.198).

The study predicts that site-specific wheat output will experience a significant loss due to climate change. This decrease, which is anticipated to be 5.5% lower than the highest yield ever recorded, points to a potential future loss in wheat output that might worsen food insecurity.

ANN(PNN) performed inadequately. The ensemble model and RF showed better yield results with R2 = 0.953, 0.791.

On the other hand, the greatest\\nvalues in historical yield were 3.90, 2.99, and 3.64 (ton/ha) for Okara, Sargodha, and\\nMultan. Specifically, field measurements across locations indicated an average peak yield\\nof 0.95 tons per hectare. However, when using climate projections from GCMs within\\nour crop modeling, the average maximum yield forecast was 0.90 tons per hectare, which\\nmeans that yield decreased by 5.56%. According to these findings, climate change is\\nprojected to reduce wheat output in these regions by at least 5.5%. In our research, we\\ndiscovered that ML models greatly improve the accuracy of wheat-yield predictions. Unlike\\ntraditional statistical methods, which struggle to consider the nonlinear and intricate\\nconnections between climate variables and crop yield, ML models—especially ensemble\\napproaches—can effectively handle high-dimensional data and capture complex patterns,\\nresulting in more dependable predictions.\\nThe improving accuracy of ML models allows farmers to build better adaptation tech-\\nniques. Farmers may make informed decisions about planting schedules, irrigation timing,\\nand crop selection based on precise production estimates. These decisions help to increase\\nresistance to adverse climate circumstances.

Discussion\\nThis work presents a novel way to predict wheat yield under climate change scenarios\\nthat employs a complex ensemble of machine learning models. The fundamental nov-\\nelty of this research is the integration of many advanced machine learning algorithms to\\nestimate wheat output based on climate data, which involves utilizing historical climate\\ndata as well as projections from GCMs. We applied a range of ML models, including RFR,\\nMLR, boosted tree regression, artificial neural networks (ANNs), XGboost, and ensemble\\nmodels, to forecast wheat yield to varying climate conditions. Subsequently, observed\\nclimate factors and yield data were used to evaluate and refine the predicted wheat-yield\\nfunction. The downscaled GCMs output for different CO2 emissions scenarios AR4 SRB1,\\nA2, and A1B were incorporated into the calibrated output response model to anticipate\\nyield trends through 2052. Focusing on local wheat data, our research aims to capture\\ngrowth characteristics, predict future trends, and enhance crop-yield projections for the\\nspecified area.'),\n",

Meanwhile, their analysis anticipated spring wheat yields will\\ndecrease by 17.5% over the same time. This separate study examined the potential effects of\\nglobal warming, specifically on winter wheat cultivation in Gansu Province, China. Their\\nresults revealed little to moderate impacts on the suitable growing region for winter wheat\\nunder various climate change scenarios forecasted for the province.\\nThe researchers [48,49] used two regional climate projection models with RCP 4.5 and\\nRCP 8.5 scenarios. The study found that environmental degradation, specifically temperature\\ntrends, has a statistically significant impact on crop yield in this region. The impacts analysis\\nfound that wheat yields may rise by up to 14% in some areas but fall 7.9–11% in others\\ndepending on temperature trends. This demonstrates that climate change, through its effects\\non warming, presents statistically significant risks to regional agricultural productivity.\\nThe research findings suggest that under projected drought conditions in South Asia,\\nthere could be a substantial decrease in wheat yield, with estimates indicating a potential\\nreduction of around 29.30% compared to normal yield levels [40]. By utilizing advanced\\nclimate and crop models, the study aims to provide insights into the future risk of yield\\nreduction under different drought intensities, highlighting the significant impact of extreme\\nweather events on crop production in the region. Ref.[50] examined wheat-yield variability\\nunder expected future climates using previous wheat-yield sensitivity data.

Conclusions\\nThe study used various advanced modeling techniques, including random forest\\nregression, BTR, ANN, MLR, and ensemble models, to forecast site-specific wheat-yield\\nresponses based on weather conditions and yield data. The ensemble model, RFR, and\\nANN(MLP) were better than boosted tree regression when it came to calibrating wheat\\noutput models for Punjab. The ensemble model did better than the others, with an R2\\nof 0.953 and an RMSE of 0.107. The study also showed that artificial neural networks\\nare good at predicting crop yields in both current and future climate scenarios. This was\\nachieved by using GCM results for many CO2 emission scenarios to do this up until 2052.\\nThe study found that higher temperatures in Punjab are more to blame for lower wheat\\nyields than lower temps. According to the study, higher temperatures during key stages of\\ngrowth may lead to lower wheat yields. You cannot say enough about how important it\\nis to think about the highest temperatures when making climate-resilient plans to protect\\nworld farming output and ways of making a living. The yield response model we used\\nis based on downscaled GCM predictions. It shows that under different climate change\\nscenarios, wheat yield will drop by 5.5% by 2052. Because of climate change, wheat output\\nis going down, which shows how important it is to have flexible growing methods. Make\\nclimate forecasts for the years up to 2052 by putting together the results of global warming\\nmodels with different scenarios for CO2 emissions. By incorporating machine learning\\n(ML) models to predict wheat yield under climate change scenarios, we gain several\\nadvantages over traditional methods. These models offer improved predictive accuracy,\\nenabling us to guide adaptation strategies and inform policy decisions. Their transformative\\npotential in agriculture underscores the importance of advanced data analytics. As we\\nprogress, refining these models and exploring their applicability across diverse regions and\\nagricultural systems will be crucial for ensuring global food security.\\nOur research identified a need for more research on crop prediction in specific areas\\nof Pakistan, particularly regarding wheat-yield forecasting in Punjab using GCM data.\\nThis study explores machine learning models’ potential in enhancing wheat-yield pre-\\ndiction in these regions. Through advanced techniques applied to agricultural data, our\\nresearch contributes to understanding climate change impacts on agriculture, offering\\ncrucial insights for developing targeted adaptation strategies in Punjab, Pakistan. Our\\ninterdisciplinary approach underscores the importance of collaborative efforts in address-\\ning climate change challenges to global food security, providing actionable insights for\\npolicymakers, agricultural experts, and farmers to develop adaptive measures and resilient\\ncrop management practices.'),\n",

The calibrated yield response model used downscaled global climate model (GCM) outputs for the SRA2, B1, and A1B average collective CO2 emissions scenarios to anticipate yield changes through 2052. Results showed that maximum temperature (R = 0.116) was the primary climate factor affecting wheat yield in Punjab, preceding the Tmin (R = 0.114), while rainfall had a negligible impact (R = 0.000). The ensemble model (R = 0.988, nRMSE= 8.0%, MAE = 0.090) demonstrated outstanding yield performance, outperforming Random Forest Regression (R = 0.909, nRMSE = 18%, MAE = 0.182), ANN(MLP) (R = 0.902, MAE = 0.238, nRMSE = 17.0%), and boosting tree (R = 0.902, nRMSE = 20%, MAE = 0.198). ANN(PNN) performed inadequately. The ensemble model and RF showed better yield results with R2 = 0.953, 0.791. The expected yield is 5.5% lower than the greatest average yield reported at the site in 2052. The study predicts that site-specific wheat output will experience a significant loss due to climate change. This decrease, which is anticipated to be 5.5% lower than the highest yield ever recorded, points to a potential future loss in wheat output that might worsen food insecurity. Additionally, our findings highlighted that ensemble approaches leveraging multiple model strengths could offer more accurate and reliable predictions under varying climate scenarios. This suggests a significant potential for integrating machine learning in developing climate-resilient agricultural practices, paving the way for future sustainable food security solutions.25pt', 'keywords': 'wheat yield; machine learning; deep learning; climate change; prediction', 'moddate': '2024-08-15T04:24:43+02:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20240815042443+02'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20240815101627+08'00'\", 'page': 24}, page_content='Sustainability 2024, 16, 6976\\n25 of 26\\n20.\\nLi, Q.C.; Xu, S.W.; Zhuang, J.Y.; Liu, J.J.; Yi, Z.H.; Zhang, Z.X.

The impact of changing climatic conditions on crop yield, particularly for staple crops like wheat, has raised concerns about future food production. By integrating historical climate data, GCM (CMIP3) projections, and wheat-yield records, our analysis aims to provide significant insights into how climate change may affect wheat output. This research uses advanced machine learning models to explore the intricate relationship between climate change and wheat-yield prediction.
