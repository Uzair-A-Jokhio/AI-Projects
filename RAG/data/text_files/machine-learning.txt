MACHINE LEARNING (ML): A BRIEF INTRODUCTION

Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
CORE CONCEPT:
Instead of being explicitly programmed with rules to solve a problem (traditional programming), ML algorithms are fed large amounts of data and use statistical methods to discover relationships within that data.

MAIN TYPES OF ML:
1.  **Supervised Learning:** The model is trained on labeled data—meaning the input data is paired with the correct output (e.g., training a system with images labeled 'cat' or 'dog'). It is used for prediction and classification.
2.  **Unsupervised Learning:** The model is trained on unlabeled data and must find hidden patterns or structures on its own (e.g., grouping customers into segments). It is used for clustering and dimensionality reduction.
3.  **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** An agent learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards for correct actions and penalties for incorrect ones. It is often used in robotics and complex decision-making systems.

ML is the driving force behind modern technologies like recommendation systems, facial recognition, autonomous driving, and large language models (LLMs).
