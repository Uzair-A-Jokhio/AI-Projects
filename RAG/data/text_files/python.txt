PYTHON: A BRIEF INTRODUCTION

Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. It was first released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum.

KEY FEATURES:

1.  **Readability:** Python emphasizes code readability with its clean, whitespace-based syntax (indentation). This makes the code easier to learn, read, and maintain than many other languages.
2.  **Versatility (General Purpose):** It is used for a vast range of tasks, including web development (Django, Flask), data science (Pandas, NumPy), machine learning (PyTorch, TensorFlow), scripting, automation, and software testing.
3.  **Interpreted:** Python code is executed line-by-line by an interpreter, which allows for fast prototyping and debugging.
4.  **Large Standard Library:** Python comes with a massive collection of modules and functions (the standard library) that handle common programming tasks without needing to install external packages.

Python's simple structure and extensive ecosystem have made it one of the most popular programming languages globally for both beginners and experienced developers.
