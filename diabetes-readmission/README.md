# Diabetes Readmission Prediction

This project aims to predict the readmission of diabetic patients using machine learning.

## Overview

The goal is to build a model that can identify patients at high risk of readmission, allowing healthcare providers to intervene and improve patient outcomes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Diabetes 130-US hospitals for 1999-2008" dataset, which can be found at [link to dataset, e.g., UCI Machine Learning Repository].

## Features

*   **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the raw data for modeling.
*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding the data through visualizations and statistical analysis.
*   **Model Training:** Building and training various machine learning models to predict readmission.
*   **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the trained models.

## Usage

1.  Install the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  Run the main notebook or script to see the analysis and model training process.
